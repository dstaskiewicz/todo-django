# todo-django

An app to let user see his games catalog with information like release date or how many hours does it take to beat the game on average. User will be able to see his progress within the game as well as see the date started and ended of each game.

A project mainly to learn django and to make an app that I can use to track my games' progress.
I'm tracking the tasks on a trello board: https://trello.com/b/B5KmHnms/djangotodo.
